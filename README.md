### Front End
Baby Steps utilizes AngularJS to render the front end. We used ui-router for application routing and built-in Angular factories for state management. All API calls are made in the corresponding factory file associated for the type of data that itâ€™s maintaining.

### Back End
Baby Steps has a custom RESTFul API built with Node.js and Express. And data management is handled by mongoose and MongoDB.
