          <p>Raising a child can be a tricky process, especially with the sheer variety of things a parent has to keep track of. A new parent has to keep track of a myriad of elements for their newborn's health. The rigors of an infant's everyday needs often keep parents so preoccupied that monitoring an infant's long term healthcare can be quite a challenge. This challenge is especially daunting for parents who have to care for multiple infants at a time, or newborns with potential developmental delays.<p>
          <h2 class="page-header text-center" style="border-bottom:5px solid #eee;">Our Solution</h2>
          <p>A newborn's growth during the first two years of life is a tremendously informative indicator of their needs in the coming years of their development. Baby steps is a healthcare support web app for parents that helps track long term indicators of a newborn's health past their day to day needs. By utilizing baby steps, a parent can visualize important developmental milestones which will serve as an indicator for a child's developmental progroess, keep track of immunization schedules, store and organize doctor's appointments, and communicate with other parents via a live chat forum. In addition to being able to handle these tasks for multiple children, baby steps offers additional recommendations for children with common developmental disabilties such as Down Syndrome and Cerebral Palsy. With these tools, baby steps can help you, as a busy parent, ensure that your newborn's long term health needs are handled with ease. </p>
