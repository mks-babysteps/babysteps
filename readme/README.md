# About


# Getting Started
* Fork a copy of the repo. Clone it to your local machine. 
  
* Next, you'll need to install the dependencies on your terminal (within client and server folder):

```
$ npm install
```
* Go to the client folder, and:

```
$ bower install
```

* To start the server and view the app on localhost:8080:

```
$ node server/server.js 
```

* You should now be able to view the app.
